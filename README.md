# Our Process:
1. Identify business questions
2. Collect and store data. Understand the data
3. Clean and prepare data
4. Visualize, Analyze and communicate data in Canvas presentation
   
# Business Scenario
You run a cruise travel company that is experiencing a decline in customers due to the frequent reporting of shark attacks worldwide. The negative media coverage is affecting customer perceptions and leading to a loss in business.
# Problem Statement
The cruise travel agency is experiencing a decline in customer bookings and revenue due to increasing fears of shark attacks, fueled by frequent media reports.
# Hypothesis
By analyzing historical shark attack data, we can identify and designate cruise routes with the lowest incidence of shark attacks. Promoting these safer routes will reduce customer fears, increase bookings, and ultimately boost revenue.
# MVP
Identify the regions with the highest and lowest shark attack incidences.
Map these regions to your existing cruise routes.
Propose new or adjusted cruise routes that avoid high-risk areas.
# Project Scoping
Identify the primary goal increasing bookings by promoting safer cruise routes.

## Collect and store data.EDA
- Import dataset
- Copy of dataset for backup
- Dimensions of the dataset
- Data types of each column
- Unique values in each of column
- Split to Categorical and Numerical
- Explore Categorical Data
- Explore Numerical Data
## Clean and prepare data
- Nan values Handling
- Columns: drop the columns with NaN
- Rows: remove all the rows have no values
- Cols names Formating
- Cols names.lower().strip()
- "Date" Col Formatting
- Create and format date column
- Convert the date to the right format with function
- "Year" Col Formating
- Extract year from date "dt.year"
- Format the datatype to int
- Drop old columns 'date', 'year'
- Drop rows with 'NaT' and 'NaN' in 'date_cleaned' and 'year_cleaned'
- "Type" Col Cleaning and Formating
- Fill all missing values with 'Unknown'
- "Age" Col Formating
- Convert values from str to integers
- Replace missing values with the mean
- Remove outliers: values > 100
- "Country" Col Formatting
- Lower and Remove empty spaces 
- Fill all missing values with 'Unknown'
- "Location" Col Formatting
- Convert to lower case and remove empty spaces before and after
- Fill all missing values with 'Unknown'
- "Activity" Col Formatting
- Convert values to lower case and remove empty spaces before and after
- Fill all missing values with 'Unknown'
- "Sex" Col Formatting
- Replace/Format invalid values
- Fill all missing values with 'Unknown'
## Visualize and communicate insights
- Shark_attacks_by_country, using .groupby()
- Number of Shark Attacks per year
- Types of Shark Attacks
- Types of activities where Attacks happened
- Sexof Victimes
