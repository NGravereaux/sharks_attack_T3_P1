# Business Scenario
You run a cruise travel company that is experiencing a decline in customers due to the frequent reporting of shark attacks worldwide. The negative media coverage is affecting customer perceptions and leading to a loss in business.
# Problem Statement
The cruise travel agency is experiencing a decline in customer bookings and revenue due to increasing fears of shark attacks, fueled by frequent media reports.
# Hypothesis
By analyzing historical shark attack data, we can identify and designate cruise routes with the lowest incidence of shark attacks. Promoting these safer routes will reduce customer fears, increase bookings, and ultimately boost revenue.
# MVP
Identify the regions with the highest and lowest shark attack incidences.
Map these regions to your existing cruise routes.
Propose new or adjusted cruise routes that avoid high-risk areas.
# Project Scoping
Identify the primary goal increasing bookings by promoting safer cruise routes.
